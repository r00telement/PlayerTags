# How To: Combine with PartyIcons

If you want to integrate the job icon to the nameplate, that is pretty simple.
Instead of re-implementing the whole part of the feature from PartyIcons, I dicided to make a simple description.

## Configuration
1. Install the Dalamud Plugin "PartyIcons"
2. Open the configuration of PartyIcons and switch to the tab "Nameplates". Set everything marked with the red area to this and ensure to not have coloring enabled.
